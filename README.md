# EigenDA Clients

⚠️ These clients are out-of-date and feature-incomplete wrt our golang [clients](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenda/tree/master/api/clients/v2). We do not currently have the bandwidth to maintain these clients given the still fast pace of EigenDA protocol changes. We strongly advise/recommend rust rollups use the [eigenda-proxy](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenda/tree/master/api/proxy) to interface with EigenDA.
